Grammar:
----------
exp ->  factor | exp ADD factor | exp SUB factor 
factor -> term | factor MUL term | factor DIV term 
term -> NUMBER

For running:
------------
1. lex calcu.l
2. yacc -d calcu.y
y.tab.c is generated which has the yyparse() func
-d option generates y.tab.h (included in a.l )
3. cc -c lex.yy.c
4. cc -c y.tab.c
5. cc lex.yy.o y.tab.o -ll -o calcu
6. calcu

Note:
-----
1. y.tab.h is generated by yacc
include it in the .l file #include "y.tab.h"  

2. yylval has the value of token 
---------------------------

3. %token lists the terminals (tokens) returned by yylex().
Terminals (or tokens) are just integer constants returned by yylex(). By convention these terminal grammar symbols are in CAPITALS

4. yylex() is called implicitly when the grammar symbols are encountered in the productions
